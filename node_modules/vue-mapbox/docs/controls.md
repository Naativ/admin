# Map controls
## Overview
Controls is UI elemetns for controling view of the map, such as scale or bearing.
You can check them out in Mapbox GL JS [documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#user%20interface)
In Vue-mapbox they exposed as Vue components, so you can control they properties and behavior dynamically by changing props.
See list of controls and they properties in [API docs](api/controls.md) 
<!-- If you just want add controls with default parameters on map initialization you can set corresponfing prop on GlMap.  
Take note that you should not use MglMap prop and control component simultaniesly. For exmaple, you should use `<mgl-map> -->

### Attribution control
Due to Mapbox [policy](https://www.mapbox.com/help/how-attribution-works/) attribution control is enabled by default. Yo can disable default attributions by setting `attributionControl` prop of MglMap to `false` and set your own attribution using AttributionControl component.

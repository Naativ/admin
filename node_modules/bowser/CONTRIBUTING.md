# Contributing

The project runs Git-flow, where the `master` branch is the development one and `production` is the production one.

In a nutshell, if you're about to propose a new feature with adding some totally new functionality to `bowser`, it's better to branch from `master` and make a PR pointing back to `master` as well.
If it's a small hotfix, fix a typo in the docs or you've added support for a new browser/OS/platform/etc, then it's better to branch from `production` and make a PR pointing back to `production`.
Following these simple rules will help to maintain the repo a lot! Thanks ❤️
